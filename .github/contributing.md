## Contribution Guide

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Prewind repository](https://github.com/art70x/prewind).
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

git clone https://github.com/art70x/prewind.git
cd prewind
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

Install the required dependencies:

```

Ensure everything is working by running the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Create a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name based on your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Examples:

- `fix-typo-in-readme`

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

- Update the code, fix bugs, or implement new features in the `src` folder.
- Ensure your changes:
  - Are properly documented.
  - Adhere to coding best practices and project conventions.
  - Are accompanied by relevant test cases, if applicable.

### Step 6: Build the Project

After making your changes, rebuild the project to generate updated files:

### Step 7: Test Your Changes

- Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work as expected.
- Use the local development server (`npm run dev`) to verify functionality.
